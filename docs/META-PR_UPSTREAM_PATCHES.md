**Title**: Propose small upstream patches to remove deprecated transitive dev dependencies

**Summary**
- This repository contains two small ready-to-apply patches that remove deprecated transitive dev-time dependencies which are producing warnings for downstream projects that consume those packages.
- Patches are included in the `patches/` directory of this repo and are intended for maintainers of the upstream projects listed below.

**Patches included**
- `patches/get-package-info-remove-lodashget.patch` — replaces `lodash.get` with a tiny inline `get` helper in `get-package-info` to avoid an unnecessary dev dependency.
- `patches/global-agent-remove-boolean.patch` — replaces the small `boolean` dependency with an equally small inline `parseBoolean` helper in `global-agent` to remove the deprecated package.

**Motivation**
- These are dev-time transitive dependencies surfaced during `npm install` and in CI logs as deprecation warnings. They do not affect runtime behavior of the upstream packages, and removing them reduces maintenance surface for downstream consumers.

**Files changed (proposed)**
- See the `.patch` files in `patches/` for exact diffs. Each patch is focused and limited to a small set of source files.

**Testing performed (downstream)**
- The `Eddict/sieve` project that triggered these warnings has had the local patches applied in a feature branch and tests run; all CI checks and `npm test` passed locally. See the repository `CHANGELOG` or PR notes for more details.

**How maintainers can apply these patches**
Option A — Quick apply locally
```bash
# Replace placeholders and run from a clone of the upstream project
git checkout -b chore/remove-deprecated-dev-deps
git apply --index /path/to/sieve/patches/get-package-info-remove-lodashget.patch
git apply --index /path/to/sieve/patches/global-agent-remove-boolean.patch
# Run tests/build for the package (may vary per project)
npm install
npm test
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove deprecated dev dependencies (replace with small inline helpers)"
git push --set-upstream origin chore/remove-deprecated-dev-deps
```

Option B — Copy the diffs manually
- Open each `.patch` file and apply the small edits to the repository via the web UI or a local edit, then run the package's tests.

**Suggested PR body for each upstream project**
- Title: Replace deprecated dev dependency `lodash.get` / `boolean` with small inline helper
- Body: Explain why (dev-time deprecation warnings, no runtime change), include link to this meta-PR, mention tests ran, and invite maintainers to accept or tweak the patch.

**Meta-PR purpose**
- This meta-PR bundles the prepared patch artifacts and the rationale in a single place, so maintainers and downstream consumers can see the small fixes and apply them in their respective upstream repositories. This PR does not change upstream repositories directly; it is a coordination artifact to speed review and application of the included patches.

**Links & references**
- Source of motivation: `Eddict/sieve` (this repo). See `docs/TRANSITIVE-DEPENDENCY-DEPRECATIONS.md` for longer background and draft issue text targeting upstream maintainers.
- Patches directory: `patches/`

**Next steps if you want me to open the meta-PR on GitHub for you**
- I can create a branch, commit this file (and optionally include the `.patch` files in a structured folder), push it to `origin` and open a PR. Pushing requires write access to `Eddict/sieve` from this environment; if you want me to push & open the PR I can try — tell me to proceed and I'll attempt to push and open the PR. If remote push fails I will give exact commands for you to run locally.
